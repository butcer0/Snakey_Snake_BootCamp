#### You have embarked on level 0 of the Snakey-Snake BootCamp
 The road is vast ahead, no time to slow. Get started immediately! 
 
##### Challenge Level 0
Several computer science languages are in prominence today. The first steps in pursuing mastery of any of these languages is the same.
In **The Level 0 Challenge** you will install and configure your development environment. In particular, if approaches wrong, the python language can be quite troublesome to maintain a stable development environment. To avoid these complexities we will be developing in what is termed a *virtual [python] environment*. This is easily facilitated by one of the leading tools available for python development - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (Free Community Edition - [Unless Student then Free Premium Licenses are Available](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/))

<p>

1. Install the Python Conda Interpreter - [MiniConda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) (*install only, do not configure*)
3. Follow along `Tech with Tim` in his first video of the as he sets up his virtual python environment and explores the basics of the IDE <br/><br/>

<p>
Once a developer has established a stable development environment, running and locating points in the code producing error is critical.

  [![Debugging in PyCharm Video Missing](http://img.youtube.com/vi/sRGpvbhOhQs/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRGpvbhOhQs "Debugging in PyCharm")
- Please create separate .py files for each example given in the video (combine where reasonable to save time/space)
- Git Commit and Push changes to your Snakey-Snake Bootcamp github repository. 
- Notify me when files available online and I will compare to answers written following these steps previously to validate completion

***Acceptance Criterion***:
To complete Challenge Level 0, please follow along `Tech with Tim` on his the second video of the basic tutorial series outlining the `Debugging`. <br/><br/>
